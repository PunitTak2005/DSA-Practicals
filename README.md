About the Repository 📘
The programs in this repository demonstrate implementations of various DSA concepts such as:

Arrays: Operations like reversing numbers.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Binary Search, etc.
Stacks and Queues: Array-based and linked-list-based implementations.
Linked Lists: Single, double, and circular linked lists.
Matrix Operations: Addition, multiplication, and traversal.
These programs aim to enhance problem-solving and analytical skills, with hands-on practice for understanding the intricacies of data structures.
