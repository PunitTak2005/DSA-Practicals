# DSA Practicals 🚀  

This repository contains practical programs for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **C** and **C++**. These programs were created as part of my academic coursework to strengthen my understanding of core DSA concepts.

## 📘 About the Repository  

This repository showcases implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:  
- **Arrays** (e.g., reversing numbers).  
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Binary Search).  
- **Stacks and Queues** (array-based and linked-list-based).  
- **Linked Lists** (singly, doubly, and circular).  
- **Matrix Operations** (addition, multiplication, etc.).  

The goal is to develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
